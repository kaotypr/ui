description: A React component library built on Base UI and Tailwind CSS
---

@kaotypr/ui is a comprehensive collection of beautifully designed, accessible React components. Built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/) primitives and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it provides a solid foundation for building modern web applications.

## Design Philosophy

@kaotypr/ui is built around three core principles:

- **Accessibility First**: Every component is built on Base UI primitives, ensuring proper keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA attributes out of the box.
- **Customization**: Components are styled with Tailwind CSS, making it easy to customize colors, spacing, and typography to match your design system.
- **Developer Experience**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions, intuitive APIs, and consistent patterns across all components.

## Key Features

- **Accessible Components**: Built on Radix UI primitives with full keyboard and screen reader support
- **Tailwind CSS Theming**: Easily customize the look and feel using Tailwind's utility classes
- **TypeScript Types**: Complete type definitions for all components and their props
- **Base UI Primitives**: Leverages battle-tested, unstyled components for complex interactions
- **60+ Components**: A comprehensive set of UI components for common patterns
