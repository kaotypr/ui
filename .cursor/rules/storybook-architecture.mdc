# Overview

This documentation provides comprehensive rules for creating Storybook stories for `@kaotypr/ui` components.

## Component Categories

There are two main categories of components, each with different story conventions:

| Category | Source Path | Story Path | Story Title Prefix | Description |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **UI Components** | `components/ui/` | `stories/ui/` | `UI/` | Primitive, reusable building blocks (buttons, inputs, dialogs, etc.) |
| **Block Components** | `components/blocks/` | `stories/blocks/` | `Blocks/` | Composed components combining multiple UI components for specific use cases |

### Key Differences

| Aspect | UI Components | Block Components |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | Low-level primitives | Higher-level compositions |
| **Reusability** | Highly reusable across contexts | Specific to certain use cases |
| **Complexity** | Simple, single-purpose | Complex, multi-purpose |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal, often built on Radix UI | Composed of multiple UI components |
| **Story Focus** | Individual props and states | Real-world usage scenarios |

## Props Documentation

When documenting component props:

1. **Reference Original Library / Libraries**: Always reference the original library's / libraries documentation for complete props or API
2. **Document ALL Props**: Include all available props from the underlying library in argTypes
3. **Include Library URL**: Add the library's URL in the component description
4. **Prop Documentation Requirements**:
   - Accurate description from the original library
   - Correct default values
   - Appropriate control types
   - Type information

> **Example**: For a component built on Radix UI, check `https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/[component]` for complete props

## Story Metadata

Every story file must include the following metadata in its Meta export:

- **title**: Following the pattern based on component category:
  - `UI/ComponentName` for UI components (from `components/ui/`)
  - `Blocks/ComponentName` for Block components (from `components/blocks/`)
- **component**: The actual component being documented
- **tags**: `['autodocs']` at the root level for automatic documentation generation
- **parameters**:
  - `layout: 'centered'` for UI components
  - `layout: 'fullscreen'` or `layout: 'padded'` for Block components (depending on the block's nature)
  - `docs: { description: { component: 'Component description' } }`
- **argTypes**: Comprehensive documentation of all component props

### Example Meta Structure for UI Components

```typescript
const meta = {
  title: 'UI/ComponentName',
  component: Component,
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered',
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'Component description and attribution'
      }
    }
  },
  argTypes: { /* prop documentation */ }
}
```

### Example Meta Structure for Block Components

```typescript
const meta = {
  title: 'Blocks/ComponentName',
  component: Component,
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  parameters: {
    layout: 'padded', // or 'fullscreen' for full-page blocks
    docs: {
      description: {
        component: 'Block description explaining its composed nature and use case'
      }
    }
  },
  argTypes: { /* prop documentation */ }
}
```

## Import Conventions

All imports in story files must use the `~/` alias for internal modules. Never use relative paths. The `~/` alias resolves to the `src/` directory.

| Module Type | Import Pattern |
|-------------|----------------|
| UI Components | `~/components/ui/{component}` |
| Block Components | `~/components/blocks/{component}` |
| Hooks | `~/hooks/{hook}` |
| Lib Utilities | `~/lib/{util}` |

## Icons Usage

Always use [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/icons/) for any icon needs. Never create custom SVG icons

## File Organization

Story files must be organized according to their component category:

### Rules

1. All story files must be placed in a dedicated folder named with the component's name
2. The folder location depends on the component category:
   - UI components: `stories/ui/{component-name}/`
   - Block components: `stories/blocks/{component-name}/`
3. Story files should mirror the component file structure
4. For component parts, stories should be in the same stories directory

### Path Mapping

| Component Source | Story Location |
|------------------|----------------|
| `components/ui/button.tsx` | `stories/ui/button/button.stories.tsx` |
| `components/ui/select.tsx` | `stories/ui/select/select.stories.tsx` |
| `components/blocks/login-form.tsx` | `stories/blocks/login-form/login-form.stories.tsx` |
| `components/blocks/data-table.tsx` | `stories/blocks/data-table/data-table.stories.tsx` |

### Example: UI Component File Structure

```
stories/ui/select/
├── select.stories.tsx
├── select-trigger.stories.tsx
└── select-content.stories.tsx
```

### Example: Block Component File Structure

```
stories/blocks/login-form/
├── login-form.stories.tsx
└── login-form-field.stories.tsx (if the block has parts)
```

## Component Structure

For any component that has multiple parts (sub-components):

1. **ALWAYS create separate story files for each part**
2. Each part story must be in its own file named `{component-name}-{part-name}.stories.tsx`
3. When a component part requires a parent context (like Drawer parts needing Drawer context):
   - Always render the part within its required parent component
   - Include minimal but necessary sibling components to demonstrate functionality
   - Document the context requirement in the component description

### Example: Component with Parts

For a Select component with SelectTrigger, SelectContent parts, create:
- `select.stories.tsx` (main component)
- `select-trigger.stories.tsx`
- `select-content.stories.tsx`

## Main Story Structure

Use `Meta<typeof Component>` and set the component field. The component description should be concise and include:

1. A single sentence describing the component's purpose
2. Attribution if component is built on top of another library
3. Component Parts section with brief descriptions

Include comprehensive argTypes for root component props only. Set `parameters.layout = 'centered'` and `tags: ['autodocs']`.

### Description Format

```markdown
A single sentence describing the component's purpose.

This component is built on top of [Library Name](library-url).

### Component Parts
- [PartName](?path=/story/ui-component-partname--default): Brief description of the part's purpose.
- [PartName2](?path=/story/ui-component-partname2--default): Brief description of the part's purpose.
```

### Description Example

```markdown
A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content.

This component is built on top of [Radix UI Accordion](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion).

### Component Parts
- [AccordionItem](?path=/story/ui-accordion-accordionitem--default): Represents a single item within the accordion.
- [AccordionTrigger](?path=/story/ui-accordion-accordiontrigger--default): The button that toggles the visibility of the item's content.
- [AccordionContent](?path=/story/ui-accordion-accordioncontent--default): The content area that is shown or hidden when the item is toggled.
```

## Part Story Structure

Use `Meta<typeof PartComponent>` and set the component field:

1. Component description must specify if the part requires a parent context
2. Include only relevant argTypes for the specific part
3. Always render parts that require context within their parent component
4. Include necessary sibling components to demonstrate functionality
5. Provide at least two examples (Default and variations)
6. Set `parameters.layout = 'centered'` and `tags: ['autodocs']`
7. Each story must have a brief description in `parameters.docs.description.story`

### Part Story Naming

- File name must be `{component-name}-{part-name}.stories.tsx`, using kebab-case for both component and part names (e.g., `form-control.stories.tsx`)
- Story title format depends on the component category:
  - **UI components**: `UI/{ComponentName}/{PartName}`
  - **Block components**: `Blocks/{ComponentName}/{PartName}`

| Category | Example Title |
|----------|---------------|
| UI | `UI/Accordion/AccordionTrigger` |
| UI | `UI/Select/SelectContent` |
| Blocks | `Blocks/DataTable/DataTableHeader` |
| Blocks | `Blocks/LoginForm/LoginFormField` |

### Context Requirements for Parts

For parts that require parent context:

1. Always wrap the part in its parent component
2. Include minimal examples of required sibling components
3. Document the context requirement in component description

**Example description**: `'The trigger element for the drawer. Must be used within a Drawer component.'`

**Example structure**:

```tsx
<Drawer>
  <DrawerTrigger {...args} />
  <DrawerContent>Minimal content</DrawerContent>
</Drawer>
```

## Links Format

All links to part/component stories in markdown should use the format based on component category:

### UI Components

```
?path=/story/ui-<component>-<part>--default
```

Example: `[SelectTrigger](?path=/story/ui-select-selecttrigger--default)`

### Block Components

```
?path=/story/blocks-<component>-<part>--default
```

Example: `[DataTableHeader](?path=/story/blocks-datatable-datatableheader--default)`

## Props and Controls

1. Only include props in argTypes that are actually supported by the component/part
2. For controlled stories, always show how to use `value` and `onValueChange` with React state, and call `args.onValueChange?.(v)` if present (to support Storybook actions)

## Consistency Rules

1. Always use the same naming and folder structure as existing stories (e.g., `UI/Select/SelectTrigger`)
2. Use `StoryFn<typeof Component>` or `StoryObj<typeof Component>` as appropriate
3. All stories should be self-contained and demonstrate the part/component in a realistic usage context

## Documentation Rules

1. Main story files should not duplicate API documentation for parts/components; instead, reference the part/component stories
2. Each part/component story should include a concise API reference and usage notes in the docs panel

## Category-Specific Guidelines

### UI Component Stories

UI components are primitive building blocks. Their stories should:

1. Focus on demonstrating individual props and states
2. Show all possible variants (sizes, colors, states)
3. Include accessibility considerations
4. Reference the underlying library (e.g., Radix UI) for complete API documentation
5. Use `layout: 'centered'` for focused component display

### Block Component Stories

Block components are compositions of multiple UI components. Their stories should:

1. Focus on real-world usage scenarios and configurations
2. Show common use cases and patterns
3. Demonstrate how the block integrates with forms, data, or other systems
4. Include examples with mock data to illustrate realistic usage
5. Use `layout: 'padded'` or `layout: 'fullscreen'` depending on the block's nature
6. Document which UI components the block is composed of in the description

### Description Format for Block Components

```markdown
A composed component for [specific use case].

This block combines the following UI components:
- [Button](?path=/story/ui-button--default)
- [Input](?path=/story/ui-input--default)
- [Card](?path=/story/ui-card--default)

### Usage
Brief explanation of when and how to use this block.

## Example: UI Component with Parts

For a UI component like Drawer (at `components/ui/drawer.tsx`) with multiple parts, create the following story files under `stories/ui/drawer/`:

| File | Story Title | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `drawer.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer` | Main component story |
| `drawer-trigger.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer/DrawerTrigger` | Trigger part story |
| `drawer-content.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer/DrawerContent` | Content part story |
| `drawer-header.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer/DrawerHeader` | Header part story |
| `drawer-footer.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer/DrawerFooter` | Footer part story |
| `drawer-title.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer/DrawerTitle` | Title part story |
| `drawer-description.stories.tsx` | `UI/Drawer/DrawerDescription` | Description part story |

## Example: Block Component

For a Block component like LoginForm (at `components/blocks/login-form.tsx`), create the following story files under `stories/blocks/login-form/`:

| File | Story Title | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `login-form.stories.tsx` | `Blocks/LoginForm` | Main block story with various configurations |

**Note**: Block components typically don't have as many parts as UI components since they are compositions themselves. If a block does have parts, follow the same naming pattern with `Blocks/` prefix.
