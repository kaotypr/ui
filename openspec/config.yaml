# Per-artifact rules
rules:
  proposal:
    - Focus on component API design and prop interfaces
    - Identify necessary Base UI primitives or external dependencies
    - Consider accessibility (a11y) implications
  
  tasks:
    - Break down implementation into granular steps:
      1. Component logic/structure
      2. Styling/Theming
      3. Storybook stories
      4. Tests (Unit/Visual)
      5. Exports
    - Group tasks by component if multiple are being added
