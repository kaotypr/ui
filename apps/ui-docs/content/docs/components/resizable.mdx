### ResizablePanelGroup

Wraps a set of resizable Panel components. Group content can be resized horizontally or vertically. Must contain `ResizablePanel` and `ResizableHandle` components as direct children.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `orientation` | `"horizontal" \| "vertical"` | `"horizontal"` | Specifies the resizable orientation |
| `defaultLayout` | `number[]` | - | Default layout for the Group. Allows layouts to be remembered between page reloads |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Disable resize functionality |
| `disableCursor` | `boolean` | `false` | Disable custom mouse cursor styles for drag state on Panels and Separators in this group |
| `id` | `string` | - | Uniquely identifies this group within an application. Falls back to useId when not provided |
| `onLayoutChange` | `(layout: number[]) => void` | - | Called when the Group's layout is changing (e.g. each time the pointer is moved during drag) |
| `onLayoutChanged` | `(layout: number[]) => void` | - | Called after the Group's layout has changed (e.g. when the pointer is released) |
| `className` | `string` | - | Additional CSS class names to apply |
| `style` | `React.CSSProperties` | - | Inline styles to apply |

### ResizablePanel

Wraps resizable content and can be configured with min/max size constraints and collapsible behavior. Must be used within a `ResizablePanelGroup`. Panel elements must be direct DOM children of their parent Group.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `defaultSize` | `number` | - | Default size of Panel within its parent group (percentage). Auto-assigned based on total number of Panels when not provided |
| `minSize` | `number` | `0` | Minimum size of Panel within its parent group (percentage) |
| `maxSize` | `number` | `100` | Maximum size of Panel within its parent group (percentage) |
| `collapsible` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether this panel can be collapsed. When resized below minSize, it collapses to collapsedSize |
| `collapsedSize` | `number` | `0` | Panel size when collapsed (percentage) |
| `id` | `string` | - | Uniquely identifies this panel within the parent group. Falls back to useId when not provided |
| `onResize` | `(panelSize, id, prevPanelSize) => void` | - | Called when panel sizes change. Receives panel size (percentage and pixels), id, and previous panel size |
| `className` | `string` | - | Additional CSS class names to apply |
| `style` | `React.CSSProperties` | - | Inline styles to apply |

### ResizableHandle

A separator between panels that enables resizing. Recommended for improved keyboard accessibility. Must be used within a `ResizablePanelGroup`. Separator elements must be direct DOM children of their parent Group.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `withHandle` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether to show a visible handle indicator on the separator |
| `id` | `string` | - | Uniquely identifies the separator within the parent group. Falls back to useId when not provided |
| `className` | `string` | - | Additional CSS class names to apply |
| `style` | `React.CSSProperties` | - | Inline styles to apply |
